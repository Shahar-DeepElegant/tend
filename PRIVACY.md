# Privacy Policy for Tend

**Effective date:** 2026-02-19

Shahar Shalev ("Service Provider") built **Tend** ("Application") as an open source mobile app. The Application is provided "AS IS".

This page explains what information the Application accesses, how it is used, and what is shared.

## TL;DR

- No accounts.
- No ads.
- No analytics and no tracking.
- No data is sent to the Service Provider’s servers.
- Your reminders and settings are stored locally on your device.
- If you allow Contacts and Notifications, they are used only to power the app’s features on your device.

## Definitions

In this policy, "collect" means data being sent off your device to the Service Provider or a third party service. Tend does not do that.

## Information Collection and Use

### Contacts (expo-contacts)

If you grant permission, the Application can access your device contacts to let you choose people and show their details in the app.

- **What is accessed:** contact names, phone numbers, and any other contact fields you choose to use.
- **How it is used:** to display and manage contact based reminders inside the Application.
- **Where it goes:** it stays on your device. It is not uploaded to the Service Provider.

You can deny or revoke Contacts permission in your device settings. Some features may be limited without it.

### Local storage (expo-sqlite)

The Application stores app data locally on your device.

- **What is stored:** reminder schedules, app settings, and related data needed for the Application to function.
- **Where it goes:** it stays on your device.

### Notifications (expo-notifications)

If you grant permission, the Application can show reminder notifications.

- **What is accessed:** notification permission status.
- **How it is used:** to deliver reminders to you on your device.
- **Where it goes:** notification content is not sent to the Service Provider.

You can deny or revoke Notifications permission in your device settings.

### Background tasks (expo-background-task)

The Application may run background tasks to keep reminders working reliably.

- **What it does:** supports scheduled reminders and basic app functionality.
- **What it sends:** nothing is sent to the Service Provider.

### Navigation (expo-router)

expo-router is used for in-app navigation only. It does not collect personal information by itself.

## Location

The Application does not collect precise real time location information.

## Third Party Services

Tend does not include third party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking tools.

Note. Your operating system and app marketplace (for example Google Play) may collect standard diagnostics or usage information outside the Service Provider’s control.

## Data Sharing

Because the Application does not send your personal information to the Service Provider’s servers, the Service Provider does not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties.

## Opt-Out and Data Deletion

- You can stop all information access by uninstalling the Application.
- You can revoke Contacts and Notifications permissions at any time in your device settings.
- Removing the Application typically removes its local data. If your device backups restore app data, you may need to delete the app data from device settings as well.

## Children’s Privacy

The Application is not intended for children under 13. The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Security

The Service Provider does not receive your personal data on servers. Keeping your device secure helps protect your data. Use a device passcode and keep your OS up to date.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. The updated version will be posted on this page with a new effective date.
